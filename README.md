# JameBot

A small Discord bot that i'm using to learn rust. The Code is questionable, I know.

This bot is created with [serenity-rs](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/) which is a Discord API wrapper.

# What is a "Jame"?

I'm only including this bit because Phoenix otherwise probably won't stop harrassing me lul.
